# Sales Tax Test

## Getting Started

- `bundle exec rspec` : Runs the test suite (not as extensive as it could be)
- `bundle exec rake`  : Will run the application but puts statements are commented out, mainly used for debugging.

## To Dos:
- Add functionality to intake quantities
- There is a failing test, I was not able to spend enough time to figure out why there is an extra space.
- Add more tests
